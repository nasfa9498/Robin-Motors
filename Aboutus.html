              <b>Knowing whether your business is considered small by the Small Business Administration is important, because the official classification carries a number of benefits.</b> <br><br>
              The SBA defines which companies are officially designated as small businesses. <br><br>
              Your industry determines whether your business’s designation depends on its number of employees or its annual revenue. <br><br>
              You can find your industry code in the U.S. Census Bureau’s NAICS publication. <br><br>
              This article is for business owners who are trying to determine whether their organization is technically considered a small business.

Then an age comes, a second one, in which you already know, at the moment when you begin to experience true happiness, that you are, at the end of the day, going to lose it. When I met Belle, I understood that I had just entered this second age. I also understood that I hadn’t reached the third age, in which anticipation of the loss of happiness prevents you from living.
